Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Key concepts in machine learning include:
1. Supervised Learning - Learning from labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. Neural Networks - Computing systems inspired by biological neural networks
4. Deep Learning - ML using multiple layers of neural networks

Applications include image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and predictive analytics.
